* ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley - Thank you for covering ray tracing basics in such a well paced and visual way.
* [Rust translation](https://heyjuvi.github.io/raytracinginrust/) of "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by @heyjuvi - Thank you for the faithful translation.

This is my implementation of the book ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) - wouldn't have been able to do it without the above sources.
